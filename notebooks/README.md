# Notebooks

This folder contains interactive notebooks for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.

Each notebook corresponds to a specific pipeline or analytical step and includes code, results, and narrative explanations.

snRNA_analysis -> Single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis identifying neuronal subtypes associated with theta and gamma oscillations.

Visium_analysis -> Visium spatial transcriptomics analysis to map the spatial distribution of theta and gamma oscillation markers.

Data_integration_analysis -> Data integration analysis of snRNA-seq and Visium spatial transcriptomics data to identify and map pyramidal and interneuron cell types linked to theta and gamma oscillations, using Seurat and RCTD deconvolution.
