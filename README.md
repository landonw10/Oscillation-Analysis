# Oscillation-Analysis
Integrated single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to map cellular and molecular organization of theta and gamma oscillation networks in hippocampal and cortical circuits during spatial object recognition. Identified distinct neuronal subtypes driving oscillatory patterns and their spatial distribution.
